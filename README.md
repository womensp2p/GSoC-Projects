Women's P2P Network develops by-women, for-women connectivity tools to build and strengthen women's communities across borders around key issues, such as ending violence, electing women to political office, and supporting micro-entrepreneurs. The long-term vision is to create a network that enables every woman on earth to connect, irrespective of computer access, language differences, and other traditional barriers. Through local and global women's “meetups” women are able to offer support and assistance with collective goals.

We intend for this to be an inspiring and safe space where women-focused technologists can collaborate to build tools that connect the world’s women!
